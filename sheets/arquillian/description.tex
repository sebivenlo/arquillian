\begin{frame}{Testing JavaEE}
\begin{itemize}
\item In the past and even today it is a problem to test JavaEE applications. 
\item Often logic is tested only with mockups.
\item If run in a server often the runtime needed to managed in the project/ test itself
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{What is Arquillian}
	Arquillian is a Test framework, that can be used for:
	 \begin{itemize}
	 	\item testing inside a remote or embedded container
	 	\item deploy an archive to a container so the test can interact as a remote client
	 \end{itemize}
	 
	 It is capable of:
	 \begin{itemize}
	 	\item Unit tests
	 	\item Persistence tests
	 	\item Functional tests
	 \end{itemize}
	 
	 Arquillian integrates with other testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit or TestNG), allowing the use of IDE, Ant, and Maven test plugins
